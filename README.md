# Build Windows PHP Extensions

~This is a fork of [shivammathur/php-extensions-windows](https://github.com/shivammathur/php-extensions-windows).
I forked this to add more extensions to the build workflow.~

The upstream [php-builder-windows](https://github.com/shivammathur/php-builder-windows "PHP Snapshots") has changed, causing many builds to fail.
I've removed the references, and this project is no longer a fork of [shivammathur/php-extensions-windows](https://github.com/shivammathur/php-extensions-windows) but still inspired by it.
